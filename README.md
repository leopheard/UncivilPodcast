America is divided, and it always has been. We're going back to the moment when that split turned into war. This is <a href="">Uncivil</a>: Gimlet Media's new history podcast, hosted by journalists Jack Hitt and Chenjerai Kumanyika. We ransack the official version of the Civil War, and take on the history you grew up with. We bring you untold stories about covert operations, corruption, resistance, mutiny, counterfeiting, antebellum drones, and so much more. And we connect these forgotten struggles to the political battlefield weâ€™re living on right now.<br>
